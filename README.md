# hello-world
As suggested by the Hello World Tutorial. The title starts with a leading hash.

A Sample of Markdown

1.  List item one.  The list begins with a lead 1 and a period.

    List item one continues with a second paragraph followed by an
    Indented block. Use 4 spaces for indent.

        $ ls *.sh
        $ mv *.sh ~/tmp

    List item continues with a third paragraph.  The code is signaled by a leading dollar.

2.  List item two continues with an open block. The item is signaled by a 2 and a period.

    This paragraph is part of the preceding list item. Indent to stay in the list item

    1. List item a.  This list is nested and does not require explicit item continuation.  Use the same technique for sublists.

       This paragraph is part of the preceding list item, because of indentation.

    2. List item b.  Sublist item
    
       This paragraph is part of list item b, and illustrates what
       happens to new lines.

    This paragraph belongs to item two of the outer list, because of indentation.
